/* Problem: Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
 * The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * Note:
 * 1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * 2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
 *
 */

/*
 * Solution: to flip the bits, we can use ~ operator. However,
 * the leading zeros would all be turned into 1, which means
 * we would get a wrong number (and it's negative).
 * So we should calculate the mask for the original number.
 * E.g., the original number is 5, which is b101, the mask should
 * be b111, we could & the mask with the complemented number to
 * remove the leading 1s.
